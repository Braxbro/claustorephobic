Version: 1.1.9
Date: ???
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when the prototype and the next_upgrade collision_mask are the same table reference
      e.g. when a mod does `prototypeA.collision_mask = prototypeB.collision_mask`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.8
Date: 2024-3-14
  Minor Features:
    - Added new setting for adjusting overall resource richness. This setting is 1 (no effect) by default, and may range between .001 and 1000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.7
Date: 2024-1-23
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed being unable to blueprint Exotic Industries' Gate entities. (This was caused by a temporary fix in 1.1.6 that is no longer necessary, and has been removed as of Exotic Industries 0.5.8.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.6
Date: 2024-1-19
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed incompatibility with Exotic Industries: Loaders.
    - Fixed incompatibility with Exotic Industries.
  Modding:
    - Improved data stage interface for other mods.
      Other mods can now use ClaustOrephobic.allowed_subgroups, ClaustOrephobic.allowed_types, and ClaustOrephobic.allowed_entity_names to exclude non-resource entities from collision modification by subgroup, prototype type, and name, respectively.
      This global is not guaranteed to be present during data.lua, but is guaranteed during data-updates.lua, and if you load before ClaustOrephobic, data-final-fixes.lua. 
      If you wish to use it before it is exposed, see ClaustOrephobic's data.lua for more information.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.5
Date: 2023-11-22
  Bugfixes:
    - Starting areas are now symmetrical across 0, 0, not 0.5, 0.5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.4
Date: 2023-10-19
  Minor Features:
    - Added new setting for the starting area shape. This setting has two options: circle, and square.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.3
Date: 2023-10-02
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix selection priority for resources.
    - Fix crash with mods that leave empty strings in Entity::next_upgrade as an empty string, rather than setting it to nil.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.2
Date: 2023-09-28
  Bugfixes:
    - Water no longer improperly collides with modded entities.
      ClaustOrephobic now uses its own collision layer for the mod's placement restrictions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.1
Date: 2023-09-28
  Locale:
    - Updated changelog for v1.1.0 to better reflect the state of the mod in that version.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug causing a crash when ClaustOrephobic modified an upgraded prototype before its predecessor.
  Modding:
    - ClaustOrephobic can now parse resource-autoplace.lua expressions found in other mods more reliably, even after they've been multiplied, clamped, etc. by another mod.
      As long as the resource-autoplace.lua expression is intact, ClaustOrephobic will find it and replace it in-place now, preserving the other mod's modifications.
    - Error handling has been improved; now invalid ores should be more reliably excluded, and more modded ores should be valid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2023-09-26
  Bugfixes:
    - Ores will now no longer obstruct cliff spawns. Requires v1.1.92 due to dependency upon ResourceEntity::cliff_removal_probability.
      The mod will still load on v1.1.91, just without the cliff fixes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
Date: 2023-09-20

    - Fixed a bug with collision masks preventing enemy expansion and offshore pump placement.
    - Fixed a bug causing trees to be significantly less frequent on ore.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
Date: 2023-05-03
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug with collision masks allowing some entities to be incorrectly placed on ore.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
Date: 2023-04-29
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash at startup accidentally shipped with v1.0.2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2023-04-28
  Bugfixes:
    - Non-starter ores no longer generate a sliver of ore in the starter ore area on pie and spiral presets, most noticeably in heavily modded saves.
      Previously, if a regular ore was first or last in the internal placement order, a tiny sliver of it would appear in the starter ore area.
      Starter ores now properly generate in place of these tiny slivers.
    - Fixed a crash with certain modded ores that accidentally got shipped with v1.0.1.
  Debug:
    - Disabled a couple of logging statements to clean up the console for other mods.
  Locale:
    - Fixed a display issue with the changelog when viewed on mods.factorio.com.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2023-04-28
  Balancing:
    - Readjusted richness expressions to more closely match normal ore generation. 
      Total ore count should be reduced nearly 200-fold compared to v1.0.0, enabling faster expansion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2023-04-27
