Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2023-04-28
  Bugfixes:
    - Non-starter ores no longer generate a sliver of ore in the starter ore area on pie and spiral presets, most noticeably in heavily modded saves.
      Previously, if a regular ore was first or last in the internal placement order, a tiny sliver of it would appear in the starter ore area.
      Starter ores now properly generate in place of these tiny slivers.
    - Fixed a crash with certain modded ores that accidentally got shipped with v1.0.1.
  Debug:
    - Disabled a couple of logging statements to clean up the console for other mods.
  Locale:
    - Fixed a display issue with the changelog when viewed on mods.factorio.com.

Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2023-04-28
  Balancing:
    - Readjusted richness expressions to more closely match normal ore generation. 
      Total ore count should be reduced nearly 200-fold compared to v1.0.0, enabling faster expansion.
